# EE200-Design-Tools-Learning-LabVIEW-
Projects build with LabVIEW and C to build state machines.

## Goal
To build a Finite State Machine where multicolor LEDs glow with different patterns when the user presses different buttons
<br><br>Built using
<ul>
  Project 1 : NAND gates, a D-Type Flip Flop and a programmable timer. Circuit Design using NI MultiSIM 
  Project 2 : NI LabVIEW and NI MyDAQ
  Project 3 : Embedded C and DSPIC33EP64MC502
</ul>

Each student had approximately five minutes to demonstrate their work and circuit realization.
