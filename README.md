# EE200-Design-Tools-Learning-LabVIEW-
Projects built with LabVIEW and C to build State Machines.

## Goal
To build a Finite State Machine where multicolor LEDs glow with different patterns depending on the buttons pressed by the user.
<br><br>Built using
<ul>
  <li>Project 1 : NAND gates, a D-Type Flip Flop and a programmable timer. Circuit Design using NI MultiSIM <br>
  <li>Project 2 : NI LabVIEW and NI MyDAQ <br>
  <li>Project 3 : Embedded C and DSPIC33EP64MC502 <br>
</ul>

Each student had approximately five minutes to demonstrate their work and circuit realization.
